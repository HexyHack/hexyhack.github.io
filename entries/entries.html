<!--Entry--><p class="entry" id="03/08/23">I've made a software list for WinXP. (03/08/23)</p>
Welcome to second entry on my blog.<br> 
I just uploaded a list of bunch applications for Windows XP. I came up with an idea of doing it when I was installing XP on my laptop, just for sharing the knowlegdge with people. And yeah, there is already one website containing tons of applications for XP, but that website of course doesn't contain every app, right?
<br> So, there is my list which you can <a href="../../others/xp.html"> check yourself</a>. For now the list contains 18 apps, maybe will be more in the future, but I won't promise.
<br> <br> Recently I've updated my whole "Useful Links" page, where you can find some random IT stuff, basically same idea as the XP list.
<br> <br> And.. If it comes to my blog, I will post another entry soon, probably something about old disks.
<br> <br> See ya!

Welcome to my blog page.<br> <br>
I came up with an idea of creating this site due to boredom and my willing to create some space where I could communicate, share my projects, ideas and etc.
I wrote this site in 2 days with some breaks, so the code behind is messy and surely needs some fixes and maybe a rebuild in the future. 
I have so many ideas I don't know what should I realise as the first, probably something from Hackintosh stuff, gonna be interesting since it will run on AMD laptop ;) <br> <br>
Also I'm thinking about a Discord server where people could join, talk and chill around, discuss about IT and PC hardware. I don't know when I will create one though. Soon I will add my Discord username on Profile section. I can imagine more direct communication through this site would look lame.<br> <br>
So, that's probably all from me. I will make another entry soon with me doing something :p
<br> <br> Thank you for reading.

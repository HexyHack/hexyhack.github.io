Welcome to second entry on my blog.<br> 
I just uploaded a list of bunch applications for Windows XP. I came up with an idea of doing it when I was installing XP on my laptop, just for sharing the knowlegdge with people. And yeah, there is already one website containing tons of applications for XP, but that website of course doesn't contain every app, right?
<br> So, there is my list which you can <a href="../../others/xp.html"> check yourself</a>. For now the list contains 18 apps, maybe will be more in the future, but I won't promise.
<br> <br> Recently I've updated my whole "Useful Links" page, where you can find some random IT stuff, basically same idea as the XP list.
<br> <br> And.. If it comes to my blog, I will post another entry soon, probably something about old disks.
<br> <br> See ya!

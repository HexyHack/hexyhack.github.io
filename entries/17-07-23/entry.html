Welcome to my blog page.<br> <br>
I came up with an idea of creating this site due to boredom and my willing to create some space where I could communicate, share my projects, ideas and etc.
I wrote this site in 2 days with some breaks, so the code behind is messy and surely needs some fixes and maybe a rebuild in the future. 
I have so many ideas I don't know what should I realise as the first, probably something from Hackintosh stuff, gonna be interesting since it will run on AMD laptop ;) <br> <br>
Also I'm thinking about a Discord server where people could join, talk and chill around, discuss about IT and PC hardware. I don't know when I will create one though. Soon I will add my Discord username on Profile section. I can imagine more direct communication through this site would look lame.<br> <br>
So, that's probably all from me. I will make another entry soon with me doing something :p
<br> <br> Thank you for reading.

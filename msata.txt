msata to usb adapter 


pros:
-you can reuse your old msata disk
-rw speeds are better than on average cheap pendrive 
-you can swap between other disks if you have more than one

cons:
-buying an adapter and disk only for this purpose is not a good idea
since you can buy a new better pendrive for the same price
-if your adapter doesnt have an enclosure you have to make one (working disk can be really hot)
-bigger than average pendrive
